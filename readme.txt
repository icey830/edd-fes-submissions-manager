EDD Frontend submissions reviews made easy

== Description ==

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads") v2.3 or greater.

Once activated, EDD FES Submissions Manager will add a new admin page that facilitates the review of pending submissions under FES menu.

How it works:
To improve your experience reviewing submissions, EDD FES Submissions Manager will distribute the pending submissions into cards.
Each card contains information about vendor, same FES submissions form and buttons to edit, view, approve o decline this submission.
Easy, right?

So, thanks to this new distribution, EDD FES Submissions Manager will save you a lot of time reviewing new submissions!

There's a [GIT repository](https://github.com/rubengc/edd-fes-submissions-manager) too if you want to contribute a patch.
